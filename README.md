# Introduction
Our shopping website localized Byredoâ€™s eCommerce site into Chinese. The company offers luxury fragrances, makeup, home, leather goods and accessories. Our localized page focused primarily on perfume & fragrance, and hand & body care products. We offered 12 products in total. 

# Localization Best Practices for Designers and Developers
The localization team assembled all best practices into a Confluence Knowledge Base so that the design and development team could easily access solutions to the most common localization problems. [Here](https://jmachuca.atlassian.net/l/cp/nWQSUyzE) is the page. If you have issues accessing the page or want to offer suggested updates, reach out to us over [email](L10Team@byredo.com).
